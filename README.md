# Angelo Chavez's Data Analysis Project Portfolio

## [Project 1: Employee Survey Data Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/angelochavez/employee-survey-data-analysis)

Presented with: Wide Dataset with unique Resp IDs and 30 Questions (some containing "subquestions" within) and optional answers (respondents don't answer every question)

Output: Long Data set showing unpivoted Questions + Subquestions and a row for each response, plus aggregated data columns

Wide Table => Long Table

## Formatting requests by the business:
* What was the original quesiton for each sub-response?
* What was the total number of responses for each question?
* How many people responded the same for each question?

**Code and Output for Question 1: What was the original quesiton for each sub-response?**
The output desired is an added column that maps each response to the original main question.
